# new feature
i want to have a new feature on my expense tracker, basically is an investment calculator, what it does is basically to calculate how much i need to contribute every month in order to hit my target amount. 

So im thinking the feature is something like this. 
1. a new side bar menu called investment calculator
2. on click the investment calculator, it will go to a new page /investment, this page can be access even without login. so means user can easily access by just putting /investment at the end of the url
3. in that page user will need to key in their target amount, their starting amount, after how many years, what is the average return rate. 
4. then user can click a button "Calculate" the system will then calculate exactly how much they need to contribute monthly to hit that target amount. 
5. the result should display a table, where each row is the year. where it will show the breakdown of each year, so user can see how much interest they earned and so on. 
6. it also will display a line graph where the X axis is the years, and the Y axis is the amount of money. so user can see the graph how the money will grow. 
7. need to make sure the design follows the current design of the expense tracker, make sure is mobile responsive as well. Make sure all the hover states and button follow the dark theme as usual.


Now dont start any coding, i want you to read this file first, and understand what i want. and tell me does it make sense? and how u plan to execute it.
